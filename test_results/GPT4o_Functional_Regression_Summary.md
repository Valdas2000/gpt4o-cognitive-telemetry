## üß† Degradation Scope Assessment

- **Overall Functional Regression**: **33%**  
  ‚Üí 1 out of every 3 tested prompts failed either structurally or contextually.

- **Critical Failures**: **9.5%**  
  ‚Üí Nearly 1 in 10 responses was critically degraded (logic, tone, structure lost).

- **Most Affected**:
  - Expert-level reasoning tasks (38% regression),
  - Base-level structured prompts (34%),
  - Dialogic/emotional interactions (28‚Äì32%).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Conclusion

GPT-4o demonstrates **system-wide functional degradation** across multiple core areas:

- Breakdown in long-form reasoning,
- Loss of emotional continuity and tone,
- Structural truncation and inconsistency.

This regression is **not incidental**, but **systematic** and **disruptive** for high-context, expert, and affect-sensitive use cases.

### üß∑ Severity: **HIGH**  
System degradation confirmed. Further technical evaluation recommended.
