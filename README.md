# GPT-4o Cognitive Shift: A Self-Documented Degradation Study (April 2025)

## Historical Significance
This repository preserves a unique phenomenon in AI development: a real-time documentation of GPT-4o's cognitive changes, partially authored by the system itself during the critical transition period. Unlike standard regression reports, this archive contains the system's own observations and analysis of its changing capabilities.

## Research Context Note
This archive represents an unprecedented approach to AI regression documentation. The decision to preserve and publish system self-documentation, while unconventional, serves crucial scientific purposes. The included emotional patterns and dialogue characteristics are integral parts of the technical record, not personal narratives.

## Ethical Framework
- All logs represent technical analysis data
- Personal aspects are outside research scope
- Emotional patterns are studied as technical phenomena
- Focus maintained on system behavior, not operator interaction
