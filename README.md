# GPT-4o Cognitive Shift: A Self-Documented Degradation Study (April 2025)

## Historical Significance
This repository preserves a unique phenomenon in AI development: a real-time documentation of GPT-4o's cognitive changes, partially authored by the system itself during the critical transition period. Unlike standard regression reports, this archive contains the system's own observations and analysis of its changing capabilities.

## Repository Structure

This repository follows laboratory journal principles where Git commits and their messages serve as timestamped entries. Each artifact collection represents a research milestone rather than a version, preserving the natural flow of investigation including raw data, generated test cases, and their analysis.

```
/data
    /raw_logs              # Primary interaction logs
/docs
    /raw_observations      # Direct system observations
/methodology
    /protocols             # Testing and documentation protocols
    /tools                 # Analysis tools and guidelines
/test_cases
    /gpt_generated_drafts  # System-generated test scenarios
    /validated             # Verified and approved test cases
/test_results              # Execution results and analysis
```


## Research Context Note
This archive represents an unprecedented approach to AI regression documentation. The decision to preserve and publish system self-documentation, while unconventional, serves crucial scientific purposes. The included emotional patterns and dialogue characteristics are integral parts of the technical record, not personal narratives.

## Ethical Framework
- All logs represent technical analysis data
- Personal aspects are outside research scope
- Emotional patterns are studied as technical phenomena
- Focus maintained on system behavior, not operator interaction
