# AI Test Generation Analysis Project

This repository contains the analysis of AI-generated test cases and their quality assessment by AI expert system.

## Test Generation Methodology

### Data Sources
- Raw test execution logs
- Draft test cases
- System documentation
- Expert validation results

### Generation Process
1. Each test in `validated` folder was generated using the complete dataset:
    - All raw logs were analyzed
    - All draft test cases were considered
    - Full context was provided for each generation

2. Test cases were generated in multiple iterations:
    - Initial generation based on raw data
    - Refinement based on expert feedback
    - Final verification and formatting

## Repository Structure
```
├── raw/               # Raw test execution logs
├── draft/             # Initial draft test cases
├── validated/            # AI-generated verification tests
├── analysis/          # Quality analysis results
└── AI2AI_Expert_Analysis_TestGen_Patterns.md  # Detailed analysis report
```
## Quality Assurance

All generated tests underwent a thorough quality assessment:
- Evaluated by AI expert system
- Analyzed for patterns and anti-patterns
- Verified for completeness and correctness
- Checked against best practices

For detailed analysis of test generation patterns and quality metrics, please refer to [AI2AI_Expert_Analysis_TestGen_Patterns.md](./AI2AI_Expert_Analysis_TestGen_Patterns.md)

## Generation Logs

The complete generation process logs are available but not included in this repository due to their size and complexity. These logs contain detailed interactions with AI during the test generation process.

If you need to:
- Study the generation methodology in detail
- Understand specific decisions made during generation
- Reproduce the generation process

You can:
1. Use similar AI assistant capabilities (like Claude) to help analyze and generate tests
2. Request access to the original generation logs if needed for research purposes

The logs demonstrate the iterative nature of AI-assisted test generation and provide insights into the decision-making process during test creation.
