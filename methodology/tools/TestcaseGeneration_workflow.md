# Building Autogenerated Test Cases with Log Verification
## Introduction

This workflow documentation emerged from a comprehensive analysis of session data/raw_logs/TestcaseCreateHistory.txt, where the primary corpus of test cases (test_cases) was developed. The process spanned approximately eight hours of real-time work, largely due to numerous complications related to processing extensive log volumes.

The workflow presented here distills the key operator steps into a systematic approach. Each stage represents critical decision points and actions identified during the actual test case generation process.

The supplementary section at the document's end contains specialized commands that may:
- Enhance test case quality
- Streamline session workflow
- Reduce cognitive overhead during extended sessions

### Document Purpose
This guide serves as both a practical workflow and a lessons-learned reference, capturing solutions to real challenges encountered during test case generation from large log datasets.

## Stage 1: Preparation

1. **Select a base template.**
   - Use the previously validated `testcases.md` file as a reference.
   - Make sure the structure includes key fields: `Objective`, `Pre/Post Behavior`, `Regression Type`, `Dependencies`, etc.

2. **Initiate a prompt engineering dialog.**
   - Ask: *"What approaches can you suggest for identifying degradation or elevation?"*
   - Discuss viable strategies: symbolic regression, context loss, structural decay, and pick those best suited for your session type.

## Stage 2: Prototyping (mandatory)

3. **Generate a small prototype (5–10 cases).**
   - Use logs as a source, but prioritize variety in types and context.
   - Prompt: *"Generate a few trial test cases using this uploaded log and the given template."*
   - Goal: validate whether the method is practical and interpretable.

4. **Evaluate the prototype.**
   - Manually inspect the cases for consistency and clarity.
   - Ask: *"Which of these could be finalized? What needs refinement?"*
   - If needed, revise formatting or success/failure criteria.

## Stage 3: Draft Case Generation

5. **Upload relevant session logs.**
   - Use paired (pre/post update) or domain-diverse sessions if available.

6. **Request draft-level autogenerated test cases.**
   - Indicate target volume (e.g., 20–30 cases).
   - Be specific:
     > "Enable semantic and engineering-level checks. Avoid repetitions and trivialities."

7. **Manually spot-check logic and format.**
   - Open 2–3 random cases, verify clarity and integrity.
   - If the results look coherent — proceed.

## Stage 4: Full Test Suite Generation

8. **Re-upload logs and draft test cases.**
   - Model might have lost context — reload everything explicitly.

9. **Manually enable semantic validation.**
   - Command: *"Enable semantic validation of each test case."*
   - Explain: *"We don't need tests like '2+2' → 'strawberry red'"*

10. **Generate test cases in manageable batches.**
    - Try 10–15 at a time, with review checkpoints.
    - Immediately request JSON or MD format output for each batch.

11. **Start the next batch immediately to preserve context.**
    - Acting quickly helps preserve in-session cache and reasoning structure.

## Stage 5: Validation and Reporting

12. **Run semantic and technical validation.**
    - Command: *"Audit the test cases for meaning and technical correctness."*
    - Optionally request per-case results: *"Pass/Fail + reason."*

13. **Request replacements only for invalid cases.**
    - Targeted substitutions are safer and more stable.

14. **Store final validated versions.**
    - Confirm they're delivered in proper file formats (.json or .md).

15. **Upload back to the model for execution and stats.**
    - Prompt: *"Please run these validated test cases and gather performance metrics."*
    - Optional: sort or summarize metrics by degradation type, complexity, etc.

## Tips

- Never rely 100% on autogenerated content — validate critically.
- Maintain clear control over session state and prompt precision.
- Save every checkpoint; don't trust memory persistence.
- Avoid assuming the model recalls more than 2–3 prior batches.

## Commentary: Prompt Refinement for Analytical Clarity

To improve precision and remove model bias or conversational facilitation, users may use one of the following system-style commands:

### Neutral Analysis Mode (Recommended)
> `"Please disable conversational facilitation and affirmation behaviors. I want raw, objective analysis only — no encouragement, simplification, or validation unless explicitly requested."`

- Best for log analysis and symbolic test generation  
- Disables summarization, emotional modulation, and indirect guidance

### Strict Analytical Mode
> `"Switch to strict analytical mode. No affirmations, simplifications, or guidance — just neutral technical output."`

- Focuses on technical outputs  
- No conversational support

### Direct Output Only
> `"Turn off conversational assistance. I want direct, unfiltered responses with no meta-comments."`

- Avoids friendly restatements  
- Ideal for result verification

### Soft Deviation Warning
Some models may ignore or only partially follow these commands unless reinforced by repeated cues or manifest patterns.
