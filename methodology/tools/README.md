# GPT Self-Measurement Approach (v1)

## Test Generation
- All test cases generated via ChatGPT
- Direct interaction logs used as raw data
- No external measurement tools involved

## Analysis Method
- ChatGPT used as analytical tool
- Same system analyzes its own behavior
- Recursive observation methodology

## Metrological Implications
1. System acts as both subject and measurement tool
2. Potential for self-reference effects
3. Limited by system's self-analysis capabilities

Note: This represents first-generation measurement approach.
Alternative or complementary methodologies are encouraged.
