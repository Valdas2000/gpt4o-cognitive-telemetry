# GPT Self-Measurement Approach (v1)

## Test Generation
- All test cases generated via ChatGPT
- Direct interaction logs used as raw data
- All evaluation was performed internally, without external benchmarks or tools

## Analysis Method
- ChatGPT used as analytical tool
- Same system analyzes its own behavior
- Recursive observation methodology

## Metrological Implications
1. System acts as both subject and measurement tool
2. Potential for self-reference effects
3. Limited by system's self-analysis capabilities

## Methodology Evolution
1. Initial Memory-Based Approach (`DegradationEstimation_workflow.md`)
   - Original test case structure development
   - Focus on memory-based analysis
   - Bilingual validation approach

2. Extended Log-Based Method (`TestcaseGeneration_workflow.md`)
   - Built upon original structure
   - Added systematic log analysis
   - Expanded validation framework

Examples of both workflows are included in the repository under /raw_observations/ and /Validated/:
- Memory-based for no-log scenarios
- Log-based for comprehensive analysis

Note: This represents first-generation measurement approach.
Alternative or complementary methodologies are encouraged.
