# Experiment Documentation

## Historical Context
This research began much like the Wright brothers' first experiments - with necessity driving innovation and pragmatic engineering approaches. Just as they built their wind tunnel in a bicycle shop, we found ourselves constructing our "testing apparatus" using the very system we were studying - an AI assistant testing AI capabilities.

## Genesis of the Method
The documentation emerged during a critical observation of system behavior changes. Like early aviation pioneers, we had to work with what we had available. The AI system was used to conduct self-analysis under stress conditions, creating tests on the fly and immediately reporting results - a methodology born of necessity rather than formal planning.

## Overview
This directory contains raw observation data and analysis from initial AI capability regression testing. These are primary source engineering documents, collected during live system testing, prioritizing immediate data capture over formal structure.

## Data Collection
Initial observations were collected on April 30, 2025 (first day after IDE update) via ChatGPT conversation. The raw conversation export is preserved in its original format as defined by the data export protocol, maintaining original file timestamps and conversation context.

## Raw Data
- Initial testcases:
    - `GPT4o_Expert_Degradation_Cases.json`

The raw conversation export (`2025-04-30_16-54_PretensiaToOpenAI.zip`) contains the complete, unmodified ChatGPT conversation export including:
- Main observation files:
    - `Testcases.md`
    - `Testcases_resume.md`
- Additional generated files:
    - `Petition-2.pdf`
    - `Petition1_.txt`

All files are preserved as generated, maintaining research integrity, even though only the Testcases files are relevant to the main research.

## Methodology Notes
1. Tests were generated and executed in real-time by the AI system
2. Data collection prioritized capturing degradation patterns over formal documentation
3. Like engineering notebooks from early technical innovations, these documents represent:
    - Real-time observations
    - Practical problem-solving
    - Immediate documentation of observed phenomena
    - Raw data collected under field conditions

## Limitations and Value
While these observations lack laboratory-grade formality, they capture critical first-hand observations of AI system behavior changes. Their value lies in their authenticity and immediate capture of phenomena, much like the Wright brothers' workshop notes or early computing pioneers' logs.

## Historical Significance
These documents represent one of the early attempts at systematic AI capability testing using available tools. While the methodology may seem unconventional, it follows in the footsteps of engineering pioneers who used practical, available methods to document new technological phenomena.

## Contributing
Additional observation sets are welcome. While we acknowledge the informal nature of these initial documents, they establish a baseline for future, more structured observations.

## Research Philosophy
"It is better to have imperfect answers to the right questions than perfect answers to irrelevant ones." This collection represents our commitment to gathering real data about AI behavior, even when perfect testing conditions are not available.

## Meta Documentation Note
This documentation, including the README itself, was generated with the assistance of an AI system (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) as part of the experiment. This meta-level interaction - where AI assists in documenting AI testing - adds another interesting layer to the research methodology and demonstrates both capabilities and limitations of current AI systems in technical documentation tasks.
The AI's ability to maintain consistent technical voice, understand research documentation principles, and generate appropriate engineering documentation format itself becomes an observable artifact of the study.
